          <p class=body>Kukin, who roomed in the wing of the same house, was standing in the yard looking up at the sky. He was the manager of the Tivoli, an open-air theatre.</p>

He works, he does his best, his very best, he tortures himself, he passes sleepless nights, he thinks and thinks and thinks how to do everything just right. And what's the result? He gives the public the best operetta, the very best pantomime, excellent artists. But do they want it? Have they the least appreciation of it? The public is rude. The public is a great boor.

          <p class="headline">The Christmas Tree and The Wedding</p>
          <p class="byline">By Fyodor M. Dostoevsky</p>
          <p class="body opening-graf"><span class="first-letter">T</span>he other day I saw a wed­ding… But no! I would rather tell you about a Christ­mas tree. The wed­ding was su­perb. I liked it im­mensely. But the other in­ci­dent was still finer. I don’t know why it is that the sight of the wed­ding re­minded me of the Christ­mas tree. This is the way it&nbsp;hap­pened:</p>
          <p class="body">Ex­actly five years ago, on New Year’s Eve, I was in­vited to a chil­dren’s ball by a man high up in the busi­ness world, who had his con­nec­tions, his cir­cle of ac­quain­tances, and his in­trigues. So it seemed as though the chil­dren’s ball was merely a pre­text for the par­ents to come to­gether and dis­cuss mat­ters of in­ter­est to them­selves, quite in­no­cently and&nbsp;ca­su­ally.</p>
          <p class="body">I was an out­sider, and, as I had no spe­cial mat­ters to air, I was able to spend the evening in­de­pen­dently of the oth­ers. There was an­other gen­tle­man pre­sent who like my­self had just stum­bled upon this af­fair of do­mes­tic bliss. He was the first to at­tract my at­ten­tion. His ap­pear­ance was not that of a man of birth or high fam­ily. He was tall, rather thin, very se­ri­ous, and well dressed. Ap­par­ently he had no heart for the fam­ily fes­tiv­i­ties. The in­stant he went off into a cor­ner by him­self the smile dis­ap­peared from his face, and his thick dark brows knit­ted into a frown. He knew no one ex­cept the host and showed every sign of be­ing bored to death, though bravely sus­tain­ing the role of thor­ough en­joy­ment to the end. Later I learned that he was a provin­cial, had come to the cap­i­tal on some im­por­tant, brain-rack­ing busi­ness, had brought a let­ter of rec­om­men­da­tion to our host, and our host had taken him un­der his pro­tec­tion, not at all con amore. It was merely out of po­lite­ness that he had in­vited him to the chil­dren’s&nbsp;ball.</p>
          
          <p class="body">They did not play cards with him, they did not of­fer him cig­ars. No one en­tered into con­ver­sa­tion with him. Pos­si­bly they recog­nised the bird by its feath­ers from a dis­tance. Thus, my gen­tle­man, not know­ing what to do with his hands, was com­pelled to spend the evening stroking his whiskers. His whiskers were re­ally fine, but he stroked them so as­sid­u­ously that one got the feel­ing that the whiskers had come into the world first and af­ter­wards the man in or­der to stroke&nbsp;them.</p>
          
          <p class="body">There was an­other guest who in­ter­ested me. But he was of quite a dif­fer­ent or­der. He was a per­son­age. They called him Ju­lian Mas­takovich. At first glance one could tell he was an ho­n­oured guest and stood in the same re­la­tion to the host as the host to the gen­tle­man of the whiskers. The host and host­ess said no end of ami­able things to him, were most at­ten­tive, win­ing him, hov­er­ing over him, bring­ing guests up to be in­tro­duced, but never lead­ing him to any one else. I no­ticed tears glis­ten in our host’s eyes when Ju­lian Mas­takovich re­marked that he had rarely spent such a pleas­ant evening. Some­how I be­gan to feel un­com­fort­able in this per­son­age’s pres­ence. So, af­ter amus­ing my­self with the chil­dren, five of whom, re­mark­ably well-fed young per­sons, were our host’s, I went into a lit­tle sit­ting-room, en­tirely un­oc­cu­pied, and seated my­self at the end that was a con­ser­va­tory and took up al­most half the&nbsp;room.</p>
          <p class="body">The chil­dren were charm­ing. They ab­solutely re­fused to re­sem­ble their el­ders, notwith­stand­ing the ef­forts of moth­ers and gov­ernesses. In a jiffy they had de­nuded the Christ­mas tree down to the very last sweet and had al­ready suc­ceeded in break­ing half of their play­things be­fore they even found out which be­longed to&nbsp;whom.</p>
          <p class="body">One of them was a par­tic­u­larly hand­some lit­tle lad, dark-eyed, curly-haired, who stub­bornly per­sisted in aim­ing at me with his wooden gun. But the child that at­tracted the great­est at­ten­tion was his sis­ter, a girl of about eleven, lovely as a Cu­pid. She was quiet and thought­ful, with large, full, dreamy eyes. The chil­dren had some­how of­fended her, and she left them and walked into the same room that I had with­drawn into. There she seated her­self with her doll in a&nbsp;cor­ner.</p>

          <p class="headline">The Christmas Tree and The Wedding</p>
          <p class="byline">By Fyodor M. Dostoevsky</p>
          <p class="body opening-graf"><span class="first-letter">T</span>he other day I saw a wed­ding… But no! I would rather tell you about a Christ­mas tree. The wed­ding was su­perb. I liked it im­mensely. But the other in­ci­dent was still finer. I don’t know why it is that the sight of the wed­ding re­minded me of the Christ­mas tree. This is the way it&nbsp;hap­pened:</p>
          <p class="body">Ex­actly five years ago, on New Year’s Eve, I was in­vited to a chil­dren’s ball by a man high up in the busi­ness world, who had his con­nec­tions, his cir­cle of ac­quain­tances, and his in­trigues. So it seemed as though the chil­dren’s ball was merely a pre­text for the par­ents to come to­gether and dis­cuss mat­ters of in­ter­est to them­selves, quite in­no­cently and&nbsp;ca­su­ally.</p>
          <p class="body">I was an out­sider, and, as I had no spe­cial mat­ters to air, I was able to spend the evening in­de­pen­dently of the oth­ers. There was an­other gen­tle­man pre­sent who like my­self had just stum­bled upon this af­fair of do­mes­tic bliss. He was the first to at­tract my at­ten­tion. His ap­pear­ance was not that of a man of birth or high fam­ily. He was tall, rather thin, very se­ri­ous, and well dressed. Ap­par­ently he had no heart for the fam­ily fes­tiv­i­ties. The in­stant he went off into a cor­ner by him­self the smile dis­ap­peared from his face, and his thick dark brows knit­ted into a frown. He knew no one ex­cept the host and showed every sign of be­ing bored to death, though bravely sus­tain­ing the role of thor­ough en­joy­ment to the end. Later I learned that he was a provin­cial, had come to the cap­i­tal on some im­por­tant, brain-rack­ing busi­ness, had brought a let­ter of rec­om­men­da­tion to our host, and our host had taken him un­der his pro­tec­tion, not at all con amore. It was merely out of po­lite­ness that he had in­vited him to the chil­dren’s&nbsp;ball.</p>
          
          <p class="body">They did not play cards with him, they did not of­fer him cig­ars. No one en­tered into con­ver­sa­tion with him. Pos­si­bly they recog­nised the bird by its feath­ers from a dis­tance. Thus, my gen­tle­man, not know­ing what to do with his hands, was com­pelled to spend the evening stroking his whiskers. His whiskers were re­ally fine, but he stroked them so as­sid­u­ously that one got the feel­ing that the whiskers had come into the world first and af­ter­wards the man in or­der to stroke&nbsp;them.</p>
          
          <p class="body">There was an­other guest who in­ter­ested me. But he was of quite a dif­fer­ent or­der. He was a per­son­age. They called him Ju­lian Mas­takovich. At first glance one could tell he was an ho­n­oured guest and stood in the same re­la­tion to the host as the host to the gen­tle­man of the whiskers. The host and host­ess said no end of ami­able things to him, were most at­ten­tive, win­ing him, hov­er­ing over him, bring­ing guests up to be in­tro­duced, but never lead­ing him to any one else. I no­ticed tears glis­ten in our host’s eyes when Ju­lian Mas­takovich re­marked that he had rarely spent such a pleas­ant evening. Some­how I be­gan to feel un­com­fort­able in this per­son­age’s pres­ence. So, af­ter amus­ing my­self with the chil­dren, five of whom, re­mark­ably well-fed young per­sons, were our host’s, I went into a lit­tle sit­ting-room, en­tirely un­oc­cu­pied, and seated my­self at the end that was a con­ser­va­tory and took up al­most half the&nbsp;room.</p>
          <p class="body">The chil­dren were charm­ing. They ab­solutely re­fused to re­sem­ble their el­ders, notwith­stand­ing the ef­forts of moth­ers and gov­ernesses. In a jiffy they had de­nuded the Christ­mas tree down to the very last sweet and had al­ready suc­ceeded in break­ing half of their play­things be­fore they even found out which be­longed to&nbsp;whom.</p>
          <p class="body">One of them was a par­tic­u­larly hand­some lit­tle lad, dark-eyed, curly-haired, who stub­bornly per­sisted in aim­ing at me with his wooden gun. But the child that at­tracted the great­est at­ten­tion was his sis­ter, a girl of about eleven, lovely as a Cu­pid. She was quiet and thought­ful, with large, full, dreamy eyes. The chil­dren had some­how of­fended her, and she left them and walked into the same room that I had with­drawn into. There she seated her­self with her doll in a&nbsp;cor­ner.</p>
